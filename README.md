In this project you'll learn to extract information from unstructured medical text. In particular, you'll learn about the following topics:

- Extracting disease labels from clinical reports
    - Text matching
    - Evaluating a labeler
    - Negation detection
    - Dependency parsing
- Question Answering with BERT
    - Preprocessing text for input
    - Extracting answers from model output 

This work is inspired by the [work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07031) done by Irvin et al.
